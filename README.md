# NinjaCash

Personal finance tracking that works offline. A progressive web app for managing income, expenses, and budgets without spreadsheets or subscriptions.

**Try it:** [ninjacash.app](https://ninjacash.app)

## Why NinjaCash?

Most finance apps are either too complex (Firefly III) or too simple (basic expense trackers). NinjaCash sits in the middle - powerful enough to track multiple accounts and currencies, simple enough to use daily.

**Key difference:** Your data lives on your device first. Sync is optional. No subscription fees for basic use.
